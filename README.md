## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

In this proyect I learn the use of the semantic HTML elements on my code, and remember the use of the background property in CSS as well as some properties from Flexbox like justify-content: space-around;
and the use of box-sizing

```html
<main class="cardContainer">
  <section>...</section>
</main>

<footer>...</footer>
```

```css
.patternCard {
  background: url(../images/bg-pattern-card.svg);
  width: 325px;
  height: 140px;
}

.statsContainer {
  height: 90px;
  background-color: white;
  border-top: 1px solid #e8e8e8;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Continued development

the correct use of the semantic elements, the use of the SVG and how to modify them, until this proyect I've not seen myself in the need of using Grid so i'll recap the flex and grid properties as well as the properties seen in this and the other proyect
